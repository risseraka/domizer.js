Functional HTML templater in JavaScript.

Disclaimer:
This HTML templater has been inspired by http://joelhughes.co.uk/lmjs-wirte-html-in-javascript-using-less-mark
which originally was inspired by http://trapm.com/vana-templating-an-utterly-sensible-templatin.

I simply tried to get the functional idea back into the tool without it to become too blotted.

Use:
html = $.TAGNAME(attributesObject, content);
